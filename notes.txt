   Things to keep in mind

Kubernetes control plane: manages Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on them. Include components like the API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager.
Kubernetes data plane: machines that can run containerized workloads. Each node is managed by the kubelet, an agent that receives commands from the control plane.

The Kubernetes control plane is a collection of components that run on master nodes to manage a Kubernetes cluster, 
while the master node is a single node that hosts the control plane components.

Node: The nodes are bare-metal servers, on-premises VMs, or VMs on a cloud provider. 
Master Node: A master node is a node which controls and manages a set of worker nodes.
